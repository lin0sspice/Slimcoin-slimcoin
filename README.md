### What is SlimCoin?
[SlimCoin](http://www.slimcoin.club) (abbreviated SLM), is the first known
[cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) designed as
a combined [proof-of-burn](http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn)/[proof-of-stake](http://slimcoin.org/static/slimcoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system)
system that can be mined using a special “Dcrypt” algorithm. SlimCoin is
build upon [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/) and [PeerCoin](http://peercoin.net/)
but is unique in being more energy efficient, as proof-of-stake blocks
require minimal energy consumption. The Dcrypt algorithm is extremely
anti-ASIC and currently can only be mined with a CPU. It is made so mining
with hardware will be inefficient, given the intensity of this algorithm,
thus forcing the users to mine through the proof-of-stake. Thus, with
SlimCoin energy consumption would decrease over time as proof-of-work
blocks become less rewarding and coin generation becomes increasingly
based on proof-of-stake block generation.

Repository Guidelines
=====================

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [SlimCoin Talk](<forum link>) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
